# Cloud Services

### Service Models
- Software as a Service (SaaS) 
    - Applications, management and UI provided over a network 
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
    - Application development frameworks, operating systems and deployment frameworks 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
    - Virtual computing, storage and network resource that can be provisioned on demand

- Looks at this a one big computer
    - Hardware (CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage) == IaaS 
    - OS is PaaS
    - Applications == SaaS

### IaaS

    - These resources are provided to the users as virtual machine instances and virtual storage. 
    - Users can start, stop, configure and manage the virtual machine instances and virtual storage.  
- Provider Manages Infrastructure: 
    - The cloud service provider manages the underlying infrastructure.   
- Pay-per-use/Pay-as-you-go: 
    - Virtual resources provisioned by the users are billed based on a pay-per-use/pay-as-you-go paradigm

- Benefits
