# Information Assurance


### Basic
– Confidentiality       
– Availability
– Integrity 
– Policy / Privacy


- More than protecting a few computers
– Deal with all aspects of information protection


### Threats
- Disclosure
- Authentication
- Intrusions
- Privacy, productivity
- Denial of Service
- Viruses


### Legal
- Different types of laws are used to protect data
    - Copyright
    - Unauthorized  Access
        - Ambiguous
        - Hard to prosecute
    - Theft
    - Domain specific (e.g. Medical information)
- International issues

- Two types
    - Criminal
    - Civil
- Focus on criminal action
    - Need to have “beyond a reasonable doubt”
    - Since cyber crime is new, the legal system is not up to speed
    - With newer laws there have been more prosecutions based on violation of a cyber crime
    - Hard to get juries to understand

### Civil
- Need 50%+ to win
    - More typical in:
        - Intellectual property issues
        - Defamation,  harassment
    - Hard to set damages
    - Have not seen people sue software companies
        - Bugs
        - Security
    - Possible in the future that people will sue companies for security breaches

### Ethical
- Security people typically have access to everything
- First Amendment rights
- Privacy 
    - Watching what people do
    - Monitoring all traffic or monitoring down to keystrokes
        - Monitor for productivity issues
        - Defamation of character
        - Sexual  harassment


### Privacy
- Just because technology allows it, does not mean that society should.
- Technology is moving faster than the rules and regulations


### Access Methods
- Physical access to information
    - At rest
    - In motion (lost laptops, tossed data)
- 3rd party physical access to information
    - Deliberate (untrusted insider)
    - Accidental (untrained insider)
- Network access to information
    - Active (break-in)
    - Passive  (watching)
    - Social (use the network to cause 3rd party access)
